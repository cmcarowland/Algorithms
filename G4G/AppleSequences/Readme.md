# Apple Sequences

There is a string of size n containing only 'A' and 'O'. 'A' stands for Apple, and 'O' stands for Orange. We have m number of spells, each spell allows us to convert an orange into an apple.

Find the longest sequence of apples you can make, given a string and the value of m.

**Your Task:**

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function appleSequence() which takes the array in the form of a string, its size n, and an integer m as input parameters and returns the largest apple sequences after converting m oranges.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

**Constraints:**

1 <= m <= n <= 10<sup>6</sup>
