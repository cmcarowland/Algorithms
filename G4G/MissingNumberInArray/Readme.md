Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.


**Your Task :**

You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function MissingNumber() that takes array and N as input  parameters and returns the value of the missing number.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


**Constraints:**
